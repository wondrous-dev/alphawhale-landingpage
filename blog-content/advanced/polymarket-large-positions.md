## Managing Large Positions

When your positions grow beyond a few thousand dollars, new challenges and considerations emerge. This guide covers managing significant capital on Polymarket.

## Defining Large Positions

What constitutes "large" varies by context:

**Relative to your capital:**
- Any position that's significant portion of your portfolio
- Positions that materially affect your financial situation
- Where losses would be meaningful

**Relative to market:**
- Positions that could move prices
- Orders that exceed readily available liquidity
- Where entry/exit takes planning

## Building Large Positions

How to enter substantial positions:

**Gradual accumulation:**
- Build over time, not all at once
- Reduces average impact on price
- Allows reassessment as you build

**Scaling approach:**
- Start with smaller size
- Add as conviction increases
- Scale back if thesis weakens

**Limit order strategy:**
- Set prices you're willing to pay
- Let orders fill over time
- Accept possibility of partial fills

## Position Sizing for Large Trades

How much to allocate:

**Portfolio percentage approach:**
- Cap single positions at X% of capital
- Typical range: 5-15% for large positions
- Lower for higher-risk bets

**Conviction-weighted sizing:**
- Larger sizes for higher conviction
- But always within maximum limits
- Account for unknown unknowns

**Correlation adjustment:**
- Reduce if correlated with other positions
- Consider total exposure to similar outcomes
- True diversification, not just multiple positions

## Monitoring Large Positions

Ongoing management:

**Regular review:**
- Check thesis validity regularly
- Monitor for new information
- Assess if anything has changed

**Price watching:**
- Understand what's driving movements
- Distinguish signal from noise
- React appropriately to significant changes

**Portfolio context:**
- How does position fit with others?
- Is exposure balanced?
- Any adjustment needed?

## Exiting Large Positions

Getting out of substantial positions:

**Planned exits:**
- Know your exit criteria in advance
- Set targets and stops
- Execute plan, don't improvise

**Gradual unwinding:**
- Scale out like you scaled in
- Reduces price impact
- Allows partial profit-taking

**Event-triggered exits:**
- New information changes thesis
- Risk tolerance exceeded
- Opportunity cost considerations

## Risk Management for Large Positions

Protecting significant capital:

**Stop-loss discipline:**
- Define maximum acceptable loss
- Stick to it regardless of emotion
- Automated if possible

**Hedging consideration:**
- Can you offset some risk?
- Related markets for protection
- Accept hedge costs as insurance

**Diversification requirement:**
- Don't let one position dominate
- Maintain portfolio balance
- Large positions need counterbalance

## Psychological Aspects

Mental challenges of large positions:

**Emotional attachment:**
- Larger stakes = bigger emotions
- Don't fall in love with positions
- Maintain objectivity

**Loss aversion:**
- Holding losers too long
- Selling winners too early
- Stick to rules, not feelings

**Overconfidence:**
- Big positions require big conviction
- But conviction isn't certainty
- Remain humble about uncertainty

## Large Position Pitfalls

Common mistakes with significant capital:

**Concentration risk:**
- Too much in one outcome
- Related positions compound exposure
- Single events can devastate

**Liquidity traps:**
- Can't exit at reasonable prices
- Forced to accept poor terms
- Size your position for liquidity

**Moving the market:**
- Your trades affect prices
- Makes honest valuation harder
