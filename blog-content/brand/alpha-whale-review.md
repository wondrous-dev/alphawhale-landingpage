## What is Alpha Whale?

Alpha Whale is a copy trading platform designed specifically for Polymarket prediction markets. It lets you automatically follow successful traders, replicating their positions proportionally in your own account.

## How Alpha Whale Works

The platform operates through a straightforward process:

**Trader identification:**
- Alpha Whale identifies top-performing Polymarket traders
- Performance data is analyzed and verified
- Quality traders are made available to follow

**User selection:**
- You browse available traders
- Review track records and trading styles
- Choose traders to follow based on your preferences

**Automated replication:**
- When followed traders make trades, your account mirrors them
- Position sizing is proportional to your allocation
- No manual intervention required

**Ongoing management:**
- Monitor performance through the platform
- Adjust allocations as needed
- Add or remove traders based on results

## Key Features

**Curated trader selection:**
Alpha Whale focuses on identifying genuinely successful traders, not just anyone who wants to be followed. This curation provides value that self-selection doesn't.

**Transparent performance data:**
Track records are clearly displayed, including returns, win rates, drawdowns, and trading patterns. You can make informed decisions about who to follow.

**Proportional replication:**
Trades are replicated proportionally based on your allocation. If a trader puts 5% in a position, you invest 5% of your allocated amount.

**Multi-trader diversification:**
Follow multiple traders to diversify across different strategies and market focus areas.

**User fund control:**
You maintain control of your funds through your own wallet. Alpha Whale facilitates trades but doesn't custody your capital.

## Who Alpha Whale Is For

Alpha Whale suits several trader types:

**Beginners:**
- Get exposure to successful strategies immediately
- Learn by observing what works
- No need to develop expertise first

**Time-constrained traders:**
- Participate in markets without constant attention
- Automation handles execution
- Periodic review rather than active management

**Diversification seekers:**
- Access multiple strategies simultaneously
- Reduce dependence on any single approach
- Portfolio-level thinking enabled

**Manual traders seeking complement:**
- Copy trading as foundation
- Personal trades where you have edge
- Balanced approach

## Trader Selection Process

Choosing who to follow matters:

**Review track records:**
- Look at length of history
- Examine consistency of returns
- Note maximum drawdowns

**Understand trading style:**
- What markets do they focus on?
- How frequently do they trade?
- What's their risk profile?

**Match to your preferences:**
- Aggressive vs. conservative
- Market type alignment
- Time horizon fit

**Diversify appropriately:**
- Don't put everything with one trader
- Mix different styles
- Consider correlation between traders

## Performance Expectations

Realistic expectations for copy trading:

**Returns reflect trader performance:**
Your results mirror who you follow, minus any fees. Choose wisely.

**Past performance doesn't guarantee future results:**
Even successful traders have losing periods. Historical returns are informative but not predictive.

**Variance is normal:**
Week-to-week and month-to-month variation is expected. Evaluate over meaningful timeframes.

**Risk exists:**
Copy trading doesn't eliminate risk. Copied trades can lose money.

## Getting Started

Steps to begin with Alpha Whale:

1. **Explore the platform** without commitment
2. **Research available traders** thoroughly
3. **Start with small allocation** to test

5. **Monitor and adjust** as needed
6. **Scale up** as confidence develops
