## Alerts for Polymarket Trading

Missing opportunities is one of the biggest challenges in prediction markets. Alpha Whale solves this through copy trading—when successful traders act, your account acts too.

## The Alert Problem

Traditional approaches have limitations:

**Manual monitoring:**
Can't watch markets 24/7. Miss opportunities while sleeping or working.

**Price alerts:**
Tell you when something happens but require manual action.

**News alerts:**
Information arrives but you still need to analyze and act.

## The Alpha Whale Solution

Copy trading provides the ultimate alert:

**Trader activity IS the alert:**
When traders you follow make moves, that's the signal.

**Automatic execution:**
The "alert" comes with built-in action—trades execute automatically.

**No delay:**
From signal to execution happens without your involvement.

**Complete coverage:**
24/7 monitoring by the traders you follow.

## How It Works

The process is seamless:

1. **Follow successful traders** on Alpha Whale
2. **They monitor markets** continuously
3. **When they trade**, your account mirrors their position
4. **You're always covered** regardless of your attention

## Benefits Over Traditional Alerts

**Allocation levels:**

**Multiple sources:**
Follow multiple traders for comprehensive coverage.

Add or remove sources as needed.

## Never Miss Important Moves

Traders you follow react to developments.

**Market mispricings:**
