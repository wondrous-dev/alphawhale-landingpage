## Welcome to Prediction Market Trading

If you're new to Polymarket, you're joining one of the most interesting developments in trading and information aggregation. Prediction markets let you trade on the outcomes of real-world events, from elections to sports to scientific discoveries.

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started safely and intelligently.

## What is Polymarket?

Polymarket is a prediction market platform where you can buy and sell shares based on the outcomes of events. It works like a stock market, but instead of trading company shares, you're trading on whether specific events will happen.

When you think something will happen, you buy "Yes" shares. When you think it won't, you buy "No" shares. Prices reflect the collective probability assessment of all traders.

## How Prediction Markets Work

The core concept is elegant. Each market poses a yes/no question about a future event. Shares are priced between $0 and $1, with the price representing implied probability.

If "Yes" shares trade at $0.70, the market collectively believes there's a 70% chance the event will occur. If you think the probability is actually higher, buying at $0.70 offers potential profit.

When the event resolves, winning shares pay $1.00 and losing shares pay $0. But you don't have to hold until resolution—you can trade in and out as odds change.

## Setting Up Your Account

Getting started requires a few steps.

**Connect a wallet.** Polymarket uses blockchain technology, so you'll need a crypto wallet. Popular options include MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and WalletConnect-compatible wallets. If you're new to crypto, Polymarket provides guidance on wallet setup.

**Fund your account.** Polymarket uses USDC, a stablecoin worth $1 USD. You can deposit USDC directly or use the platform's onramps to convert from traditional currency.

**Explore the interface.** Before trading, familiarize yourself with how to find markets, read odds, and place orders.

## Understanding the Interface

The Polymarket interface shows you essential information at a glance.

**Market listings** display current questions and their prices. You can browse by category or search for specific topics.

**Price charts** show how odds have moved over time, helping you understand market sentiment and momentum.

**Order placement** lets you specify what you want to buy, how much, and at what price.

**Your portfolio** tracks your current positions, profit/loss, and available balance.

## Reading Odds Correctly

Understanding what prices mean is fundamental.

A market showing "Yes: $0.65 / No: $0.35" means the market believes there's a 65% chance of Yes and 35% chance of No. These prices should roughly add to $1.00.

If you think the actual probability of Yes is 80%, buying at $0.65 looks attractive—you believe you're getting shares worth $0.80 for only $0.65.

If you think the probability is only 50%, the current price of $0.65 seems too high. You might bet on No instead.

## Placing Your First Trade

Let's walk through making a trade.

1. **Find a market** you have an opinion on. Start with something you understand well.

2. **Assess the current price.** Does it seem right based on your knowledge? If not, you've identified a potential trade.

3. **Decide your position.** If the market is underpricing your expected outcome, buy those shares. If overpricing, buy the opposite.

4. **Choose your amount.** Start very small—perhaps $5-20—until you're comfortable with how everything works.

5. **Select order type.** Market orders execute immediately at current prices. Limit orders let you specify your price but may not fill immediately.

6. **Confirm and execute.** Review your order and submit it.

## How Much to Start With

Begin with money you can afford to lose completely. This isn't pessimism—it's smart risk management while you're learning.

Many beginners start with $50-200. This is enough to make trading meaningful while limiting potential losses during the learning curve.

As you gain experience and demonstrate success, you can gradually increase your trading capital.

## Essential Concepts for Beginners

Several concepts are crucial for new traders.

**Liquidity** measures how easily you can buy or sell without moving prices. High-liquidity markets have tight spreads; low-liquidity markets might cost you more to enter and exit.

**Resolution** is when the market closes and pays out. Some markets resolve quickly; others remain open for months or years.

**Spread** is the difference between buy and sell prices. You generally buy at a slightly higher price than you could sell, which represents a transaction cost.

**Volatility** describes how much prices move. Volatile markets offer more trading opportunities but also more risk.

## Risk Management Basics

Protecting your capital should be your top priority.

**Never bet more than you can afford to lose.** Prediction markets involve real risk of total loss on any position.

**Size positions appropriately.** Experienced traders typically risk only 2-5% of their capital on any single bet.

**Diversify.** Don't put all your money in one market or correlated outcomes.

**Accept losses gracefully.** Losing is part of trading. The goal is winning more than you lose over time.

## Common Beginner Mistakes

Learn from others' errors.

**Betting too big too soon.** Start small until you understand what you're doing.

**Overconfidence in opinions.** Just because you feel certain doesn't mean you're right. Markets aggregate many informed opinions.

**Ignoring fees and spreads.** Transaction costs reduce returns. Account for them in your expectations.

**Chasing losses.** Don't increase bets to recover from losses. This typically makes things worse.

**Not doing research.** Surface-level impressions aren't enough. Successful trading requires genuine understanding.

## Finding Good Markets

Not all markets are equally suitable for beginners.

**Start with markets you understand.** If you follow politics closely, political markets might suit you. If you're a sports fan, sports markets might be easier to analyze.

**Look for liquidity.** Active markets with good volume are easier to trade than thin markets.

**Check resolution timelines.** Shorter-term markets provide faster feedback on your decisions.

**Avoid overly complex markets.** Multi-outcome or conditional markets can confuse beginners.

## Copy Trading for Beginners

If you're not sure you can analyze markets well, copy trading offers an alternative.

Copy trading platforms like Alpha Whale let you automatically follow successful traders. When they buy, you buy. When they sell, you sell.

This is a great way to participate in prediction markets while you learn. You can observe what experienced traders do while benefiting from their expertise.

As you gain knowledge, you can gradually transition to more independent trading.

## Building Knowledge

Successful trading requires ongoing learning.

**Follow the news** in areas you trade. Political markets require political awareness; sports markets require sports knowledge.

**Understand market history.** How have similar events resolved in the past? What factors influenced outcomes?

**Learn from your trades.** After positions resolve, analyze whether your reasoning was sound.

**Study successful traders.** Copy trading lets you observe what works.

## Realistic Expectations

Set appropriate expectations for your trading journey.

**You will lose trades.** Even successful traders lose frequently. The goal is winning more than you lose.

**Learning takes time.** Don't expect profitability immediately. Focus on learning and improving.

**Returns vary widely.** Some periods will be profitable, others not. This is normal.

**Expertise develops gradually.** Each trade teaches you something if you're paying attention.
