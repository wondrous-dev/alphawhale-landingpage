## Why Timing Matters

When you enter and exit positions significantly impacts your returns. Good timing can turn a good idea into a great trade, while poor timing can turn a good idea into a loss.

Timing affects entry price, exit price, holding period, and opportunity cost. Mastering timing improves execution and profitability.

## Entry Timing Strategies

When to enter positions:

**Early entry:** Enter before information becomes widely known.

**News timing:** Enter before scheduled news events.

**Technical timing:** Enter on chart patterns or indicators.

**Value timing:** Enter when price is favorable relative to probability.

**Momentum timing:** Enter when momentum is building.

## Exit Timing Strategies

When to exit positions:

**Profit targets:** Exit when reaching predetermined profit levels.

**Time-based:** Exit after holding for target period.

**Resolution proximity:** Exit as resolution date approaches.

**News events:** Exit before or after major events.

**Technical signals:** Exit on chart patterns or indicators.

## Pre-News Positioning

Entering before news breaks:

**Anticipate events:** Research what's expected and position accordingly.

**Build gradually:** Enter positions before news to avoid premium prices.

**Use limit orders:** Set orders at target prices before news.

**Monitor information flow:** Track sources that might break news early.

**Risk management:** Size positions appropriately for pre-news uncertainty.

## News Event Timing

Trading around news:

**Before news:** Enter if you have strong conviction about likely outcomes.

**During news:** React quickly when news breaks (requires speed).

**After news:** Enter after initial volatility settles.

**Fade moves:** Counter-trade if initial reactions seem overdone.

**Post-news analysis:** Trade on implications that become clear later.

## Time-of-Day Patterns

Intraday timing considerations:

**Market hours:** Some markets are more active during specific hours.

**Liquidity patterns:** Trade when liquidity is highest.

**News timing:** Major news often breaks during business hours.

**Global markets:** Different time zones affect activity.

**Weekend patterns:** Activity may decrease on weekends.

## Day-of-Week Patterns

Weekly timing patterns:

**Monday activity:** Markets may be more active after weekends.

**Mid-week:** Often highest activity periods.

**Friday:** Activity may decrease before weekends.

**Event days:** Specific days with scheduled events.

**Historical patterns:** Learn patterns for your focus markets.

## Resolution Proximity Timing

Timing relative to resolution:

**Far from resolution:** More time for thesis to play out.

**Approaching resolution:** Prices tend to converge toward outcomes.

**Final days:** High volatility and rapid price movements.

**Exit timing:** Consider exiting before final volatility.

**Opportunity cost:** Don't tie up capital unnecessarily long.

## Market Cycle Timing

Understanding market cycles:

**Market creation:** New markets may price inefficiently initially.

**Maturation:** Markets become more efficient over time.

**News cycles:** Markets move through news-driven cycles.

**Resolution convergence:** Prices move toward $0 or $1 as resolution nears.

**Post-resolution:** Markets close after resolution.

## Technical Timing

Using charts for timing:

**Support/resistance:** Enter near support, exit near resistance.

**Breakouts:** Enter on breakouts, exit on breakdowns.

**Trend following:** Enter in direction of trend.

**Reversals:** Enter on reversal signals.

**Indicators:** Use technical indicators for timing signals.

## Fundamental Timing

Timing based on information:

**Information advantage:** Enter when you have information others don't.

**Information diffusion:** Enter before information becomes widely known.

**Catalyst timing:** Enter before expected catalysts.

**Thesis timing:** Enter when thesis becomes more likely.

**Exit timing:** Exit when information is fully priced in.

## Liquidity Timing

Trading when liquidity is best:

**High volume periods:** Trade when volume is highest.

**Active hours:** Trade during most active trading hours.

**Avoid thin periods:** Don't trade when liquidity is low.

**Spread awareness:** Trade when spreads are tightest.

**Execution quality:** Better execution during high liquidity.

## Event-Driven Timing

Timing around specific events:

**Elections:** Enter before polls, exit after results.

**Earnings:** Enter before announcements, exit after.

**Debates:** Enter before, exit after or during.

**Data releases:** Enter before, exit after data.

**Policy decisions:** Enter before, exit after decisions.

## Common Timing Mistakes

Errors to avoid:

**Chasing moves:** Entering after prices have already moved significantly.
