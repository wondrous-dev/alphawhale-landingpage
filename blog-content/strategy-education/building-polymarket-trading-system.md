## Why Build a Trading System?

A trading system provides structure, consistency, and objectivity. Instead of making ad-hoc decisions, you follow a defined process that helps you make better trades and avoid common mistakes.

Systems help remove emotion from trading, ensure you follow your strategy, and make it easier to track and improve your performance.

## Core Components of a Trading System

Every trading system needs:

**Market selection criteria:** How you choose which markets to trade.

**Entry rules:** When and how you enter positions.

**Position sizing:** How much you risk on each trade.

**Exit rules:** When and how you exit positions.

**Risk management:** How you protect capital and manage losses.

**Review process:** How you track performance and improve.

## Market Selection Framework

Define what markets you'll trade:

**Categories:** Which types of markets (politics, sports, crypto, etc.).

**Liquidity requirements:** Minimum volume or spread criteria.

**Time horizons:** How long until resolution you're comfortable with.

**Edge identification:** What gives you an advantage in selected markets.

**Avoidance criteria:** What markets you'll skip (ambiguous resolution, too volatile, etc.).

## Entry Rules

Define when you enter positions:

**Signal identification:** What conditions trigger entries (news, technical patterns, fundamental analysis).

**Confirmation requirements:** What additional signals you need before entering.

**Timing rules:** When during the day or market cycle you'll enter.

**Price rules:** Specific price levels or conditions for entry.

**Documentation:** Write down your reasoning for each entry.

## Position Sizing Rules

Determine how much to risk:

**Base sizing method:** Fixed percentage, Kelly, or variable sizing.

**Maximum limits:** Caps on single positions and total exposure.

**Correlation adjustments:** How you account for related positions.

**Account size scaling:** How sizing changes as your account grows.

**Conviction tiers:** Different sizes for different confidence levels.

## Exit Rules

Define when you exit:

**Profit targets:** Price levels where you'll take profits.

**Stop losses:** Price levels where you'll cut losses.

**Time-based exits:** Exiting after a certain holding period.

**Fundamental changes:** Exiting when new information changes your thesis.

**Technical signals:** Chart patterns or indicators that trigger exits.

## Risk Management Framework

Protect your capital:

**Maximum drawdown limits:** When you'll reduce size or stop trading.

**Correlation limits:** Maximum exposure to related markets.

**Daily/weekly limits:** Maximum risk per time period.

**Position limits:** Maximum number of concurrent positions.

**Reserve capital:** Always keep some capital uncommitted.

## Research Process

How you gather and analyze information:

**Information sources:** Where you get news and data.

**Analysis methods:** How you evaluate information.

**Research checklist:** Standard questions you answer before trading.

**Time allocation:** How much time you spend on research.

**Documentation:** Recording your research and reasoning.

## Execution Process

How you place trades:

**Order types:** When to use market vs. limit orders.

**Timing:** Best times to execute trades.

**Order splitting:** When and how to split large orders.

**Review before execution:** Final checklist before placing orders.

## Performance Tracking

Monitor your results:

**Trade journal:** Record every trade with entry, exit, reasoning, and outcome.

**Key metrics:** Track win rate, average win/loss, profit factor, Sharpe ratio.

**Category performance:** How you perform in different market types.

**Time analysis:** Performance by time of day, day of week, etc.

**Regular reviews:** Scheduled times to analyze performance.

**What worked:** Identify successful patterns and strategies.

**What didn't work:** Learn from losses and mistakes.

**System adjustments:** How and when you'll modify your system.

**Avoid over-optimization:** Don't curve-fit to past data.

## System Documentation

Write everything down:

**Trading plan:** Complete description of your system.

**Rules document:** Clear, specific rules for all decisions.

**Checklists:** Pre-trade and post-trade checklists.

**Examples:** Sample trades showing how rules apply.

**Updates log:** Track changes to your system over time.

## Common System Types
