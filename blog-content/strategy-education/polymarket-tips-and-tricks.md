## Beyond the Basics

Once you understand how Polymarket works, the next step is refining your approach. These tips and tricks come from experienced traders who've learned what works through practice.

Some are tactical execution tips; others are strategic principles. All can help improve your results.

## Timing Tips

When you trade matters as much as what you trade.

**Trade before news, not after.** Once information is public, it's already reflected in prices. Position yourself beforehand if you anticipate likely outcomes.

**Avoid trading right at market open.** When new markets launch, prices are often volatile and spreads wide. Wait for things to settle.

**Watch for slow news absorption.** Not everyone sees news immediately. Sometimes you can trade on information that's public but not yet fully priced in.

**Be aware of timezone effects.** Markets are global, but trading activity varies by time. American political markets might be more liquid during US business hours.

## Execution Tips

How you execute trades affects your returns.

**Use limit orders for larger positions.** Market orders can move prices against you, especially in less liquid markets. Limit orders let you specify your price.

**Check the order book before trading.** See what liquidity exists at various price levels. This helps you size appropriately and set realistic limit prices.

**Split large orders.** Rather than placing one big order, break it into smaller pieces to reduce market impact and get better average prices.

**Be patient with limit orders.** You don't have to get filled immediately. A better price that takes an hour to fill is often worth waiting for.

## Research Tips

Better research leads to better trades.

**Go to primary sources.** Don't rely on media interpretations—look at actual polling data, official statements, or original documents.

**Check multiple information sources.** Single sources can be biased or wrong. Triangulate across several reliable sources.

**Understand resolution criteria.** Before trading, know exactly what conditions will trigger Yes or No resolution. Ambiguity can lead to surprises.

**Study similar past events.** How have comparable situations resolved historically? Past patterns often inform future probabilities.

## Risk Management Tips

Protect your capital with these practices.

**Never risk your entire bankroll.** Always keep reserves. If you're fully invested, you can't take advantage of new opportunities.

**Set position limits before you trade.** Decide your maximum size before analyzing the market to avoid convincing yourself that "this time is different."

**Use mental stop-losses.** Decide in advance at what price you'll exit. Write it down. Stick to it.

**Track correlation between positions.** Multiple bets that depend on similar outcomes aren't truly diversified. A single event could sink them all.

## Market Selection Tips

Choose your markets wisely.

**Focus on your expertise areas.** You'll have better insights in domains you actually understand.

**Avoid markets with unclear resolution.** Ambiguous criteria lead to disputes and unexpected resolutions.

**Check trading volume.** Higher-volume markets are easier to enter and exit at fair prices.

**Consider time horizon.** Match market duration to your preferred holding period. Don't tie up capital for months if you prefer shorter-term trading.

## Psychological Tips

Mind games matter in trading.

**Write down your reasoning.** Before trading, document why you're making the bet. This creates accountability and enables later review.

**Set a trading budget per day or week.** Limits prevent overtrading driven by boredom or chasing.

**Take breaks after big wins or losses.** Emotional states affect judgment. Cool down before making more decisions.

**Don't watch positions constantly.** Checking prices every five minutes creates anxiety without improving decisions.

## Copy Trading Tips

If you're using copy trading through platforms like Alpha Whale:

**Diversify across multiple traders.** Don't put everything with one trader, regardless of their track record.

**Understand traders' styles.** Some are aggressive; some are conservative. Match their approach to your risk tolerance.

**Review performance regularly.** Past performance doesn't guarantee future results. Monitor ongoing performance.

**Start with smaller allocations.** Test how copy trading works for you before committing significant capital.

## Hidden Efficiency Tips

Small improvements compound over time.

**Track all your trades.** Spreadsheets or trading journals help you identify patterns in your successes and failures.

**Calculate true returns.** Account for fees, spreads, and opportunity costs. Paper profits aren't the same as actual returns.

**Review losing trades especially carefully.** Losses teach more than wins if you analyze them honestly.

**Set trading hours.** Dedicated focus time beats scattered attention throughout the day.

## Advanced Tips

For experienced traders looking for edge:

**Watch for arbitrage between related markets.** Sometimes related markets imply conflicting probabilities. These discrepancies occasionally offer profit.

**Monitor whale activity.** Large traders can move markets. Sometimes following their positions is informative.

**Use conditional thinking.** "If X happens, what will Y market do?" This forward-looking analysis helps you prepare for scenarios.

**Build position gradually.** Scale into positions over time rather than going all-in immediately.

## Things to Avoid

Anti-tips are equally valuable.

**Don't chase markets that have already moved.** If you missed the move, you missed it. Wait for the next opportunity.

**Don't average down into losing positions.** Sometimes cutting losses is smarter than adding to them.

**Don't trade just because you're bored.** No trade is better than a bad trade.

**Don't ignore small losses.** They compound into big losses if you're not careful.

**Don't overtrade.** More activity doesn't mean more profit. Often it means more costs and more mistakes.

## Building Good Habits

Success comes from consistent good practices.

**Morning routine.** Start each trading day reviewing your positions and any overnight developments.

**Pre-trade checklist.** Before any trade, run through key questions: Why this trade? What's my edge? What's my exit plan?

**End-of-day review.** What trades did you make? What went well? What could improve?

**Weekly analysis.** Look at overall performance, biggest winners and losers, and patterns to adjust.

## Tools and Resources

Make use of helpful resources.

**Market alerts** notify you of price movements so you don't have to constantly watch.

**Analytics tools** help you track performance and analyze traders.

**News aggregators** keep you informed on topics relevant to your markets.

**Copy trading platforms** like Alpha Whale provide automation for following successful traders.

## Getting Better Over Time

Improvement is a process, not an event.

**Track your predictions.** Keep records of what you predicted and what actually happened. This calibrates your judgment over time.

**Learn from others.** Study what successful traders do. Copy trading is one way; reading and observation are others.

**Stay humble.** Markets regularly prove even confident predictions wrong. Maintain appropriate uncertainty.

**Keep learning.** Markets evolve. What worked last year might not work next year. Stay curious and adaptive.
