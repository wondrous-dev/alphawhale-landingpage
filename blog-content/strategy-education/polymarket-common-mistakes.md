## Why Mistakes Matter

Mistakes cost money. Learning from common errors helps you avoid them and improve your results faster. Many traders repeat the same mistakes, so understanding what to avoid is as important as knowing what to do.

This guide covers the most frequent mistakes Polymarket traders make and how to avoid them.

## Trading Without Edge

The biggest mistake:

**The problem:** Trading without any competitive advantage.

**Why it happens:** FOMO, overconfidence, or lack of self-awareness.

**The cost:** Without edge, you're essentially gambling.

**The solution:** Only trade when you have a clear reason to expect profit.

**How to avoid:** Ask "Why will I profit?" before every trade.

## Poor Position Sizing

Sizing errors:

**Too large:** Positions that risk too much capital.

**Too small:** Positions too small to matter.

**No limits:** No maximum position limits.

**Solution:** Use systematic position sizing with clear rules and limits.

## Ignoring Risk Management

Risk management failures:

**No stop losses:** Entering without exit plans.

**Moving stops:** Adjusting stops to avoid losses.

**Overconcentration:** Too much capital in similar positions.
