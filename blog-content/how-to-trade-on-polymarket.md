Polymarket is the world's largest prediction market platform, where you can bet on real-world events—from elections to crypto prices to sports outcomes. Unlike traditional betting, prediction markets aggregate collective intelligence to create accurate probability estimates.

If you're new to Polymarket or want to improve your trading strategy, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know.

## What is Polymarket?

Polymarket is a decentralized prediction market platform built on Polygon. Users can buy and sell shares in event outcomes, with prices representing the market's probability estimate. For example, if "Bitcoin hits $100k by 2026" is trading at $0.70, the market thinks there's a 70% chance it happens.

**Key features:**
- Trade on real-world events (politics, crypto, sports, etc.)
- Prices reflect collective probability estimates
- Decentralized and permissionless
- Low fees compared to traditional betting
- 24/7 trading on global events

## Getting Started: Your First Trade

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

Polymarket requires a crypto wallet. The most common options are:

- **MetaMask** (browser extension)
- **WalletConnect** (mobile wallets)
- **Coinbase Wallet**

1. Visit [polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com)
2. Click "Connect Wallet"
3. Select your wallet provider
4. Approve the connection

### Step 2: Fund Your Account

You'll need USDC (USD Coin) to trade. You can:

- **Buy USDC directly** on Polymarket using a credit card
- **Transfer USDC** from another wallet or exchange
- **Bridge tokens** from Ethereum mainnet to Polygon

**Pro tip:** Start with a small amount ($50-100) to learn the platform before committing larger sums.

### Step 3: Find a Market

Browse markets by category:
- **Politics** (elections, policy outcomes)
- **Crypto** (price predictions, protocol launches)
- **Sports** (game outcomes, player performance)
- **Economics** (Fed decisions, inflation data)
- **Entertainment** (awards, releases)

Click any market to see the available outcomes and current prices.

### Step 4: Place Your First Trade

Let's say you want to bet that "Bitcoin will hit $100k by 2026" (currently trading at $0.70):

1. Click on the market
2. Choose "Yes" or "No" outcome
3. Enter the amount you want to bet
4. Review the order (you'll see potential profit/loss)
5. Confirm the transaction

If you buy "Yes" shares at $0.70 and Bitcoin hits $100k, each share pays out $1.00—a $0.30 profit per share (43% return).

## Understanding Polymarket Odds

Polymarket prices represent probabilities. Here's how to read them:

- **$0.50** = 50% chance (coin flip)
- **$0.70** = 70% chance (likely)
- **$0.90** = 90% chance (very likely)
- **$0.10** = 10% chance (unlikely)

**Important:** Prices fluctuate based on new information, news, and trader sentiment. A market at $0.70 doesn't guarantee a 70% outcome—it reflects the market's current estimate.

## Common Trading Strategies

### 1. Value Betting

Look for markets where you believe the probability is mispriced. If you think an event has a 60% chance but it's trading at $0.45, that's a value bet.

**Example:** A crypto protocol launch is trading at $0.30, but you've researched the team and believe it's 70% likely to succeed. Buy "Yes" shares.

### 2. Arbitrage

Find markets with inconsistent pricing across outcomes. If "Yes" is $0.60 and "No" is $0.50, you can profit by buying both sides.

**Warning:** True arbitrage opportunities are rare and get filled quickly by bots.

### 3. Information Edge

Use your expertise or research to find mispriced markets. If you follow crypto closely, you might spot price movements before the market reflects them.

### 4. Copy Trading

Follow successful traders and mirror their positions. Platforms like Alpha Whale automate this process, letting you copy top performers automatically.

## Polymarket Trading Fees

Polymarket charges:
- **2%** on winning positions (when you sell or resolve)
- **No fees** on losing positions
- **Gas fees** for blockchain transactions (usually $0.01-0.05 on Polygon)

**Example:** You buy $100 worth of shares and they resolve at $150. You pay $3 in fees (2% of $150), netting $147 profit.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Over-Trading

Don't trade on every market. Focus on areas where you have an edge or can do research.

### 2. Ignoring Fees

2% fees add up. Make sure your expected value accounts for fees, especially on small positions.

### 3. Emotional Trading

Don't let FOMO or fear drive your decisions. Stick to your strategy and risk management rules.

### 4. Not Diversifying

Don't put all your capital in one market. Spread risk across multiple positions.

### 5. Ignoring Liquidity

Low-liquidity markets can have wide spreads. You might buy at $0.70 but only be able to sell at $0.65, eating into profits.

## Advanced Tips

### Use Limit Orders

Instead of market orders, set limit prices. You might get better fills and avoid slippage.

### Monitor Your Positions

Set up alerts for markets you're trading. Prices can move quickly on breaking news.

### Research Before Trading

Read market descriptions, check resolution criteria, and understand what you're betting on. Not all markets resolve as expected.

### Track Your Performance

Keep a trading journal. What worked? What didn't? Learn from your mistakes.

## Automating Your Strategy

Manual trading works, but it's time-consuming. That's where automation comes in.
