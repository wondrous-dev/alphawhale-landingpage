## Sports in Prediction Markets

Sports prediction markets let you trade on athletic outcomes—from championship winners to individual games and player achievements. Unlike traditional sportsbooks, these markets enable full trading throughout the season.

## How Sports Prediction Markets Differ

Key differences from traditional sports betting:

**Trading, not betting:** Buy and sell positions as circumstances change.

**Market-set odds:** Prices reflect trader consensus, not bookmaker lines.

**Long-term focus:** Many markets span entire seasons.

**No house edge:** Platform fees instead of built-in margins.

**Continuous adjustment:** Rebalance positions throughout the season.

**Championship predictions:**
- Super Bowl winner

## Championship Market Dynamics

**Early season:** Overreaction to small sample sizes.

**Mid-season:** Prices stabilize as trends emerge.

**Playoff push:** Prices converge as field narrows.

**Playoffs:** Highest intensity, binary outcomes each round.

## Managing Sports Prediction Risk

Sports trading carries inherent risks:

**Single elimination events:** One game can end championship hopes.

**Injury impact:** Key player injuries dramatically shift odds.

**Variance:** Sports outcomes have significant randomness.

**Baseball (MLB):**
- Very long season
- High game-to-game variance
- Playoff randomness notable
- Pitching matchups matter

## Seasonal Timing

When you trade matters:

**Offseason:** Position on expected changes (trades, signings).

**Preseason:** Identify mispriced expectations.

**Early season:** React to surprises, fade overreactions.

**Mid-season:** Most stable prices, clearest information.

**Late season:** Trade on playoff positioning.

**Playoffs:** High intensity, binary outcomes.
