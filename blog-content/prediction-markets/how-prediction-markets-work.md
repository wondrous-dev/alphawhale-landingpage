Prediction markets work differently from traditional markets. Understanding their mechanics is essential before trading. The basic concepts are simple, but the implications for trading strategy run deep.

At their core, prediction markets let people trade shares based on future events. Prices reflect collective probability estimates. The market aggregates many individual views into a single number that represents what traders collectively believe.

## The Basic Mechanics

Every prediction market centers on a question with a yes or no answer. Will a candidate win? Will a price reach a certain level? Will an event happen by a specific date?

Traders buy shares representing outcomes. YES shares pay out if the event happens. NO shares pay out if it does not.

Prices typically range from close to zero to close to one dollar. A 60 cent price for YES implies the market estimates a 60% probability of that outcome.

When the event resolves, winning shares pay $1.00. Losing shares pay $0.00. The market closes and positions are settled automatically.

## Price Discovery

Prices are not set by a bookmaker. They emerge from trading activity.

When traders think an outcome is more likely than the current price implies, they buy. This pushes prices up. When they think an outcome is less likely, they sell. This pushes prices down.

The result is continuous price discovery. Prices adjust as new information arrives and traders express updated views.

This process aggregates information from many participants. Each trader contributes their unique knowledge and perspective. The market price synthesizes all these inputs.

## Why Markets Get Prices Right

Prediction markets have a strong track record of accurate forecasting. Several mechanisms explain this.

**Incentives matter.** Traders have financial stakes in being accurate. Wrong beliefs cost money. Right beliefs make money. This filters out uninformed opinions.

**Skin in the game.** Expressing an opinion in a survey is free. Placing a bet requires commitment. The financial requirement makes market prices more reliable than surveys.

**Diverse participation.** Markets include specialists, analysts, and observers. This diversity of perspectives improves collective accuracy.

**Continuous updating.** Unlike polls taken at a single moment, markets update constantly as new information arrives.

**Self-correction.** When prices diverge from reality, traders have incentive to push them back. Mispricings create opportunities that draw corrective trading.

## Trading on Prediction Markets

Trading involves buying and selling shares at market prices.

**Market orders** execute immediately at the best available price. You get your shares fast but may not get the price you wanted.

**Limit orders** specify the price you are willing to pay. Your order executes only if someone is willing to trade at that price.

**Buying YES shares** means betting the event will happen. You profit if the outcome occurs.

**Buying NO shares** means betting the event will not happen. You profit if the outcome does not occur.

**Selling shares** exits a position before resolution. You might sell to lock in profits or cut losses based on price changes.

## Resolution and Settlement

When the event occurs or the deadline passes, the market resolves.

Resolution criteria are defined in advance. The market description specifies exactly what constitutes a YES or NO outcome.

Winning shares automatically receive $1.00 each. Losing shares become worthless. Your account is credited or debited accordingly.

Understanding resolution criteria is critical. Ambiguous markets or unexpected interpretations can lead to unexpected outcomes.

## Liquidity and Spreads

Not all markets are equally tradeable.

**Liquidity** refers to how easily you can buy and sell. High-liquidity markets have many traders and tight spreads. Low-liquidity markets have fewer traders and wider spreads.

**Spread** is the difference between the best buy and sell prices. In a market with a 60 cent YES price, you might be able to buy at 61 cents and sell at 59 cents. The 2 cent spread represents trading cost.

Liquid markets are easier to trade. You can enter and exit positions with minimal price impact.

## Fees and Costs

Trading involves several costs.

**Platform fees** are charged on trades, typically a small percentage.

**Spreads** create implicit costs when you cross from buy to sell prices.

**Gas fees** apply on blockchain-based platforms like Polymarket, though these are typically small on layer-2 networks.

These costs affect profitability. Your trading edge must exceed total costs to profit.

## Types of Markets

Prediction markets cover many categories.

**Political markets** predict elections, legislation, and government appointments.

**Economic markets** predict data releases, policy decisions, and market outcomes.

**Crypto markets** predict token prices, protocol developments, and industry events.

**Sports markets** predict game outcomes and player performance.

**Entertainment markets** predict awards, show results, and celebrity events.

The breadth of available markets means opportunities exist across many domains.

## Who Trades

Various participants trade prediction markets.

**Informed traders** have expertise or information that helps them assess probabilities more accurately than others.

**Systematic traders** apply algorithmic or rule-based strategies across many markets.

**Copy traders** follow successful traders rather than developing their own strategies. Platforms like Alpha Whale facilitate this approach.

**Market makers** provide liquidity by offering to buy and sell continuously.

**Retail traders** participate for entertainment or based on personal views.

## Finding Opportunities

Profitable trading requires identifying mispricings.

**When your assessed probability differs significantly from market price**, opportunity may exist. If you believe an outcome has a 70% chance but the market prices it at 55%, the market may be wrong.

**When new information arrives**, prices adjust gradually. Early traders capture value before full adjustment.

**When emotions drive prices**, overreactions create opportunities for patient traders.

**When markets conflict**, inconsistencies between related markets may offer arbitrage.

The challenge is distinguishing genuine mispricings from situations where the market knows something you do not.

## Getting Started

If prediction markets interest you, take a methodical approach.

**Understand the platform.** Learn how Polymarket or your chosen platform works before trading.

**Start small.** Use money you can afford to lose while learning.

**Focus on markets you understand.** Your edge comes from knowledge and analysis.

**Track your trades.** Record reasoning and outcomes to improve over time.

**Consider copy trading.** Following successful traders through platforms like Alpha Whale lets you participate while learning.

## Conclusion

Prediction markets work by allowing traders to buy and sell shares based on future event outcomes. Prices emerge from trading activity and reflect collective probability estimates.

The mechanics are straightforward. The challenge is using them profitably. This requires finding genuine mispricings, managing risk properly, and executing with discipline.

Understanding how these markets work is the foundation for everything else. Master the basics before developing sophisticated strategies.
