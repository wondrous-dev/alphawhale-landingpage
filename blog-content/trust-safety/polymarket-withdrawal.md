## Withdrawing from Polymarket

Understanding how to withdraw funds is essential before trading. This guide covers Polymarket's withdrawal process, timing, and what to expect.

## How Withdrawals Work

Polymarket uses blockchain-based withdrawals:

Understanding withdrawal limitations:

**Available balance:** Cash not currently in positions.

**Closed positions:** Funds from sold or resolved positions.

**Not withdrawable:** Funds currently in open positions.

This involves additional steps and potential fees.

## Troubleshooting

If withdrawals aren't working:

1. **Check position status:** Funds may be in open positions.
2. **Verify network:** Blockchain might be congested.
3. **Check wallet:** Ensure wallet is properly connected.
4. **Review transaction:** Look up status on blockchain explorer.
5. **Contact support:** If issues persist.

## Withdrawal Security

Protecting withdrawals:
