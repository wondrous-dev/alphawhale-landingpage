Polymarket prices confuse many new traders. Unlike traditional betting odds, prediction markets express probabilities directly as prices. Understanding this system is essential for making informed trading decisions.

A share trading at 65 cents means the market believes there is roughly a 65% chance that outcome will happen. If the event occurs, each share pays out one dollar. If it does not, shares become worthless.

This simple system contains layers of nuance that separate profitable traders from those who consistently lose money.

## How Polymarket Pricing Works

Polymarket uses a binary outcome system. For each event, you can buy YES shares or NO shares.

YES shares pay $1.00 if the event happens and $0.00 if it does not. NO shares pay $1.00 if the event does not happen and $0.00 if it does.

Prices typically range from a few cents to near a dollar. A YES price of 70 cents means you pay 70 cents for the chance to receive $1.00 if the outcome occurs. Your potential profit is 30 cents, or about 43% of your investment.

The NO price in this case would be around 30 cents. Buying NO means you pay 30 cents for the chance to receive $1.00 if the event does not occur. Your potential profit is 70 cents, or about 233% of your investment.

## Price as Probability

The most important concept is that price represents implied probability.

A 60 cent price means the market collectively believes there is approximately a 60% chance of that outcome. This probability is not anyone's individual opinion. It is the result of many traders expressing views through buying and selling.

When someone believes the true probability is higher than the market price, they buy. When someone believes it is lower, they sell. This continuous process pushes prices toward the collective best estimate.

The market is often called the wisdom of crowds. Many individual guesses, when aggregated through trading, often produce remarkably accurate probability estimates.

## Reading Market Sentiment

Prices tell you what the market thinks, but watching price changes reveals sentiment shifts.

A price moving from 50 to 55 cents indicates increasing confidence in that outcome. The probability estimate has risen from 50% to 55%.

Rapid price movements after news events show how the market is processing new information. A debate performance might move a candidate's price 10 points in minutes as traders update their assessments.

Volume and liquidity add context. High volume on a price move suggests strong conviction. Low volume moves are less meaningful and more easily reversed.

## When Markets Are Wrong

Markets are not always right. If they were, there would be no opportunity to profit.

Mispricings occur for several reasons.

**Slow information processing.** News takes time to spread and be understood. Early traders capture value before the market fully adjusts.

**Emotional overreaction.** Panic or euphoria can push prices beyond what the information justifies. Mean reversion traders profit when these extremes normalize.

**Thin liquidity.** In less traded markets, prices may not reflect the true consensus. Large traders can move prices without reflecting genuine probability changes.

**Coordination problems.** Even when many traders believe a price is wrong, acting on that belief requires capital and risk tolerance that not everyone has.

Finding these mispricings is the core of profitable prediction market trading. You are looking for situations where you believe the true probability differs significantly from the market price.

## Calculating Expected Value

Expected value determines whether a trade makes mathematical sense.

The formula is simple: (Probability of Winning x Potential Profit) minus (Probability of Losing x Potential Loss).

If you believe a 60 cent market should actually be 70%, here is the calculation:

- Potential profit if right: $0.40 (paying 60 cents to receive $1.00)
- Potential loss if wrong: $0.60 (losing your investment)
- Expected value: (0.70 x $0.40) minus (0.30 x $0.60) = $0.28 minus $0.18 = $0.10

A positive expected value of 10 cents per share suggests the trade makes sense. Over many similar trades, you should profit.

The challenge is accurately estimating the true probability. If your 70% estimate is wrong and the market's 60% is correct, your expected value is actually negative.

## Probability Estimation Challenges

Estimating true probabilities is difficult. Several traps catch inexperienced traders.

**Overconfidence.** People systematically overestimate their own judgment. What feels like a 70% probability might actually be 55%.

**Base rate neglect.** Specific information can distract from underlying probabilities. A positive poll for a trailing candidate might not matter if they are far behind.

**Availability bias.** Vivid or recent information has outsized impact on probability estimates. A dramatic news event might seem more important than it actually is.

**Confirmation bias.** We seek information that supports our existing views and discount contradictory evidence.

Awareness of these biases helps, but does not eliminate them. Systematic approaches that rely less on subjective judgment can reduce their impact.

## Understanding Spreads

The difference between buy and sell prices is the spread. It represents transaction costs beyond explicit fees.

If you can buy YES at 61 cents and sell at 59 cents, the spread is 2 cents. This means you lose 2 cents immediately upon entering a position if you need to exit quickly.

Tight spreads indicate liquid markets where entering and exiting positions is cheap. Wide spreads indicate illiquid markets where trading is expensive.

Spreads matter more for short-term traders than long-term holders. If you plan to hold until resolution, entry spread is less important than final outcome.

## Time and Probability

As events approach, uncertainty decreases and prices become more extreme.

A market at 60 cents months before an event might move to 75 or 85 cents as the event nears, even without new information. This reflects reduced uncertainty rather than changed probability.

Similarly, prices near 50 cents often move away from that level as resolution approaches. The market is less willing to price outcomes as toss-ups when the answer will be known soon.

Understanding this time dynamic helps traders anticipate price movements separate from fundamental probability changes.

## Practical Applications

These concepts translate into practical trading approaches.

**Look for mispricings.** When your assessed probability differs significantly from market price, consider trading.

**Size positions based on edge.** Larger edge justifies larger positions. Small edges require smaller positions to manage risk.

**Monitor price movements.** Watching how prices respond to news helps you understand market dynamics and spot opportunities.

**Consider liquidity.** Avoid markets where spreads eat your potential profits. Focus on liquid markets where execution is efficient.

**Be humble.** Remember that your probability estimates are uncertain. The market is often right when you think it is wrong.

## Using Odds in Copy Trading

Some traders avoid probability estimation entirely by copy trading successful traders.

Instead of calculating expected values yourself, you follow traders with proven track records. Their positions implicitly express views on odds. Your job becomes selecting which traders to follow rather than assessing individual markets.

Platforms like Alpha Whale facilitate this approach by tracking trader performance and automating the copying process.

## Conclusion

Polymarket odds are probability estimates expressed as prices. Understanding this system is foundational for profitable trading.

Prices reflect collective market judgment but are not always correct. Finding mispricings where your probability estimate differs from market price creates opportunities.

Expected value calculations determine whether trades make mathematical sense. But accurate probability estimation is challenging and subject to many biases.

Whether you trade based on your own probability assessments or follow others through copy trading, understanding how odds work helps you make better decisions and avoid common mistakes.
